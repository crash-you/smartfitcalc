        questions: [
            {
                q: "How accurate are your calculators?",
                a: "Our calculators use scientifically validated formulas (Mifflin-St Jeor, US Navy Method, etc.) that are accurate within 5-10% for most people. They provide excellent starting points, but individual results may vary. We recommend tracking your progress for 2-3 weeks and adjusting as needed.",
            },
            {
                q: "Do you store my personal data?",
                a: "No. All calculations happen directly in your browser. Your personal measurements are never transmitted to our servers or stored anywhere. We take your privacy seriously.",
            },
            {
                q: "Are the calculators free to use?",
                a: "Yes, all our calculators are completely free with no hidden fees, subscriptions, or account requirements. We believe everyone should have access to these essential fitness tools.",
            },
            {
                q: "Should I use metric or imperial units?",
                a: "Our calculators currently use metric units (kg, cm). If you only know your measurements in imperial units, you can convert: 1 inch = 2.54 cm, 1 pound = 0.453 kg.",
            },
            {
                q: "How often should I recalculate my TDEE?",
                a: "We recommend recalculating every 4-8 weeks, or whenever your weight changes by more than 2-3 kg, your activity level changes significantly, or you hit a plateau.",
            },
        ],
    },
    {
        category: "Nutrition & Fitness",
        questions: [
            {
                q: "What is TDEE and why does it matter?",
                a: "TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is the total number of calories you burn in a day. It matters because it determines how much you need to eat to lose weight (eat less than TDEE), maintain weight (eat at TDEE), or gain weight (eat more than TDEE).",
            },
            {
                q: "How much protein do I need?",
                a: "For general health: 0.8-1.0g per kg body weight. For active individuals and athletes: 1.6-2.2g per kg. For weight loss while preserving muscle: 1.8-2.4g per kg. Our Macro Calculator can help you determine your optimal intake.",
            },
            {
                q: "What's the difference between BMI and body fat percentage?",
                a: "BMI is a simple ratio of weight to height and doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat. Body fat percentage tells you what portion of your weight is fat tissue. Two people with the same BMI can have very different body fat levels.",
            },
            {
                q: "How fast should I lose weight?",
                a: "A safe and sustainable rate is 0.5-1% of body weight per week (about 0.5-1 kg for most people). Faster loss often results in muscle loss, metabolic slowdown, and eventual regain.",
            },
            {
                q: "Can I build muscle and lose fat at the same time?",
                a: "Yes, this is called 'body recomposition.' It's most effective for beginners, those returning after a break, or those with higher body fat. It requires adequate protein (2g/kg+), strength training, and a small caloric deficit or maintenance calories.",
            },
            {
                q: "What activity level should I choose?",
                a: "Be honest and slightly conservative. 'Sedentary' is desk job with minimal exercise. 'Lightly active' is 1-3 workouts/week. 'Moderately active' is 3-5 workouts/week. Most people overestimate their activity level.",
            },
        ],
    },
    {
        category: "Using Your Results",
        questions: [
            {
                q: "I'm eating at a deficit but not losing weight. Why?",
                a: "Common reasons: 1) Inaccurate calorie tracking (use a food scale), 2) Overestimated activity level, 3) Water retention masking fat loss, 4) Metabolic adaptation after prolonged dieting. Track consistently for 2-3 weeks before adjusting.",
            },
            {
                q: "Should I eat back exercise calories?",
                a: "If you selected an accurate activity level that includes your exercise, those calories are already factored in. If you chose 'sedentary' and track workouts separately, you can eat back 50% of estimated exercise calories (trackers often overestimate).",
            },
            {
                q: "What if the calculator results seem wrong for me?",
                a: "Calculator results are estimates. Use them as a starting point, track your weight and intake for 2-3 weeks, then adjust. If you're not seeing expected results, reduce or increase calories by 100-200 and monitor again.",
            },
            {
                q: "Is it safe to eat below my BMR?",
                a: "Generally, no. Eating significantly below your BMR long-term can slow metabolism, cause muscle loss, nutrient deficiencies, and hormonal issues. A deficit of 500-750 calories below TDEE (not BMR) is usually the maximum recommended.",
            },
