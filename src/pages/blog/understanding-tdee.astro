                If you've ever wondered why your diet isn't working or how many
                calories you actually need, the answer lies in understanding
                your TDEE. This guide will break down everything you need to
                know.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
                What Exactly is TDEE?
            </h2>
            <p>
                TDEE stands for <strong>Total Daily Energy Expenditure</strong>.
                Simply put, it's the total number of calories your body burns in
                a single day, including everything from breathing and digesting
                food to exercising and walking up stairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think of TDEE as your body's daily calorie budget. If you eat
                exactly this amount, you'll maintain your current weight. Eat
                less, and you'll lose weight. Eat more, and you'll gain weight.
            </p>

            <div
                class="rounded-xl bg-primary-50 p-6 my-6 border border-primary-100"
            >
                <p class="font-bold text-primary-800 mb-2">The Simple Truth:</p>
                <ul class="text-primary-700 space-y-1">
                    <li>• Eat below TDEE = Weight loss</li>
                    <li>• Eat at TDEE = Maintain weight</li>
                    <li>• Eat above TDEE = Weight gain</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
                The Four Components of TDEE
            </h2>
            <p>Your TDEE is made up of four distinct parts:</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
                1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) - 60-70%
            </h3>
            <p>
                This is the largest component—the calories your body burns just
                to stay alive while at complete rest. Even if you laid in bed
                all day doing nothing, your heart would still beat, your lungs
                would breathe, and your cells would repair themselves. All of
                this requires energy.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
                2. Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) - ~10%
            </h3>
            <p>
                Digesting food actually burns calories! Protein takes the most
                energy to digest (20-30%), followed by carbs (5-10%), then fats
                (0-3%). This is one reason high-protein diets are effective for
                weight loss.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
                3. Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) - 15-30%
            </h3>
            <p>
                This includes all the calories you burn through daily activities
                that aren't exercise: walking to your car, typing, fidgeting,
                standing, even thinking. NEAT varies hugely between people and
                can account for hundreds of calories difference per day.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
                4. Exercise Activity (EAT) - 5-10%
            </h3>
            <p>
                Surprisingly, intentional exercise typically accounts for the
                smallest portion of TDEE for most people. That 1-hour gym
                session might burn 300-500 calories, but your daily NEAT and BMR
                do most of the heavy lifting.

                How to Calculate Your TDEE
            </h2>
            <p>
                The most common method is the <strong
                    >Mifflin-St Jeor equation</strong
                >, which calculates your BMR based on age, weight, height, and
                gender. Then you multiply by an activity factor:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sedentary (desk job): BMR × 1.2</li>
                <li>Lightly active: BMR × 1.375</li>
                <li>Moderately active: BMR × 1.55</li>
                <li>Very active: BMR × 1.725</li>
                <li>Extremely active: BMR × 1.9</li>
            </ul>

                Why TDEE Matters for Your Goals
            </h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
                For Weight Loss
            </h3>
            <p>
                Create a caloric deficit by eating 300-500 calories below your
                TDEE. This results in steady, sustainable fat loss of about
                0.5-1 lb per week without extreme hunger or muscle loss.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
                For Muscle Gain
            </h3>
            <p>
                Eat 200-400 calories above your TDEE to provide your body with
                the extra energy needed for muscle growth. Combined with
                resistance training and adequate protein, this leads to lean
                mass gains.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">
                For Maintenance
            </h3>
            <p>
                Eating at your TDEE maintains your current weight. This is
                useful after reaching your goal or during recovery phases.
            </p>

                Common TDEE Mistakes to Avoid
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Overestimating activity level:</strong> Be honest—most
                    people are less active than they think.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Not adjusting over time:</strong> As you lose weight,
                    your TDEE decreases. Recalculate every 4-8 weeks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ignoring NEAT:</strong> Try to increase daily movement—park
                    farther away, take stairs, walk during calls.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cutting too aggressively:</strong> Eating way below TDEE
                    slows metabolism and causes muscle loss.
                </li>
            </ol>

                The Bottom Line
            </h2>
            <p>
                Understanding your TDEE is arguably the most important concept
                in nutrition. It removes the guesswork from dieting and gives
                you a concrete number to work with. Whether your goal is fat
                loss, muscle gain, or maintaining your current physique, TDEE is
                your starting point.
